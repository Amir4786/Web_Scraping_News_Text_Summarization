A senior police officer said they used to post advertisements on Facebook using the photo of industrialist Mukesh Ambani to trap people. According to police, the recent victim of the fraud filed a complaint, saying he came in touch with the group through an advertisement pop-up on Facebook that promised huge returns on stock market investment. Following a tip-off, a police team busted an illegally running fake call centre and arrested 13 accused along with two foreign nationals late at night on Tuesday. \"They used to lure victims through advertisements pop-ups on Facebook, Instagram and other social networking sites about huge returns on stock market investment. Then these fraudsters used to scam people by making them invest in fake trading websites named Lexa Trade and Grow Line,\" Priyanshu Dewan, ACP, cyber said. \"They used to make virtual accounts of victims on these websites and then ask for an amount to invest. After victims invested some money, initially, they used to return some amount as profit to gain their confidence. \"Later, they asked them to invest a bigger amount for more profit which they never returned.

       "  ' Gurugram Woman Locked Herself In With Son For 3 Years. What She Told Cops ',\n",
       "  'Munmun Majhi, 33, locked herself and her son at their Gurugram home for three years because she was terrified that the 10-year-old would \"die of Covid as soon if he stepped out\", a police officer said after the two were rescued yesterday and hospitalised for a thorough check-up. The bizarre instance of Covid-induced paranoia came to light a week ago when the woman\\'s husband Sujan Majhi approached the police. Mr Majhi, an engineer with a private company, told police that his wife had locked herself and her son at home for three years now. He told them that he had stepped out to work after the lockdown restrictions ended, and was not allowed back in. Since then, Mr Majhi had been paying the rent, clearing bills, and buying groceries and leaving them outside the main door. He initially stayed at friends\\' and relatives\\' homes, hoping this would end soon. But when his wife did not budge, he rented another accommodation. The account was so shocking that the police did not believe it initially. When they called Ms Majhi, she said she and her son were \"absolutely fit\". \"We then made a video call, and when I saw the child, I became emotional. His hair had grown to his shoulders,\" the officer said. The child, who was seven when the pandemic struck, is about 10 now. For three years, he had not seen anybody other than his mother. He drew and wrote on walls. \"His mother was in panic over Covid. She had no intent of stepping out. She kept saying, \\'I will not let my son step out because he will die immediately\\',\" the officer said. \"I kept talking to her, kept asking her if she needs any help. I think she started trusting me. So when I called her to the police station today, she came, but the child was not with her. We finally managed to convince her. She was taken to a hospital, and we then went to the flat to rescue the child,\" the officer told mediapersons. When the police and child welfare teams entered the flat, they were in for a shock. For three years, garbage had not been thrown out, and the apartment was a sea of filth. Piles of clothes, hair, empty grocery packets were on the floor and a thick layer of dirt had settled on all appliances. In one of the dirty bedrooms, the 10-year-old boy, his hair now cropped, had a blank look as he saw several people, led by his father, enter the house. He has now been hospitalised. \"There was so much garbage inside that if a few more days had passed, anything untoward could have happened,\" assistant sub-inspector Praveen Kumar told news agency PTI. \"The woman has psychological issues. Both of them have been referred to PGI, Rohtak. They have been admitted to the psychiatric ward for treatment,\" said Dr Virender Yadav, Gurgaon Civil Surgeon. Mr Majhi, overjoyed to have his family back, thanked the police for their help. \"Now they are being treated. I hope my life will be back on track soon,\" he told news agency ANI.

       "  'The woman\\'s son had not even seen the sun in the last three years (Representational photo) A 33-year-old woman, who had locked herself and her minor son for three years in their rented house in Gurugram\\'s Chakkarpur area to avoid COVID-19, was brought out of confinement on Tuesday by a team of officials, police said. A team of police, health department officials and members of the child welfare department broke open the main door of the house and rescued Munmun Majhi and her 10-year-old son, they said. The mother-son duo was rushed to the civil hospital in Gurugram. \"The woman has some psychological issues. Both of them are referred to PGI, Rohtak where they are admitted to psychiatric ward for treatment,\" said Dr Virender Yadav, Civil Surgeon, Gurugram. The matter came to light on February 17 when Munmun\\'s husband Sujan Majhi, who is an engineer with a private company, approached assistant sub-inspector Praveen Kumar deployed at Chakkarpur police post. During the three years of confinement with her son, the woman did not allow even her husband into the house after he stepped out to go to office when restrictions eased after the first lockdown in 2020, police said. Sujan spent the first few days with friends and relatives and after failing to persuade his wife, he started to stay in another rented accommodation in the same locality. Sujan said that video calls were the only way to stay in touch with his wife and son. He would pay the monthly rent of the house, clear the electricity bills, deposit his son\\'s school fees, buy groceries and vegetables and even leave the bags of ration outside the main door. \"Initially, I didn\\'t believe Sujan\\'s claims, but when he made me talk to his wife and son over a video call, I intervened in the matter. The house where the woman was living had accumulated so much filth and garbage that if a few more days had passed, anything untoward could have happened,\" ASI Kumar told PTI. The woman\\'s son had not even seen the sun in the last three years, Kumar said, adding that she did not even use cooking gas and storage water during these three years in fear of Covid. Sujan was overwhelmed to have his wife and son after three years, and thanked the police. \"Now they are being treated and I hope my life will be back on track soon,\" he said.

The District Town Planner (Enforcement) has sent a notice to Chintels India Pvt Ltd asking it to vacate Towers E and F of Chintels Paradiso Society after they have been declared unsafe for residents. The towers in Sector 109 here were declared unsafe to live in by the administration on Tuesday. The District Town Planner (Enforcement) said in view of the dilapidated condition of these towers, if any untoward incident happens, the builder will be held responsible. \"There is rapid and widespread corrosion of reinforcement almost throughout the structure. This corrosion is due to chlorides that were mixed into the concrete at the time of its production. The need to frequent repair in the structures, as has been reported by the residents, also appears to have been caused by the corrosion of steel reinforcement due to the presence of these chlorides,\" the notice read. \"A poor quality of concrete has also played a role in the rapid deterioration. Given the high chloride content in the concrete almost throughout the structure, a repair of these structures for safe usage is not technically and economically feasible. In the current condition, due to the rapid corrosion of reinforcement because of the presence of chlorides, the structure is not safe for habitation,\" it said.

       "  'Those injured in the leopard attack on Wednesday are undergoing treatment. The forest department has taken the leopard that had strayed into the district court complex and attacked 10 people to the Shivalik forests in Saharanpur district where it will be freed in the wild, officials said on Thursday. \"The department has sought permission from the chief wildlife warden of Lucknow to release the wild cat,\" Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Manish Singh told PTI. He said it is difficult to ascertain where the animal strayed from because there is no identified forest area in Ghaziabad. \"We are trying to trace the route taken by the leopard by following its footprints. The animal must have strayed from the forests of Garh Mukteshwar, approximately 70 kilometres away,\" he added. The animal attacked and injured 10 people at the district court complex on Wednesday, triggering panic and a four-hour operation by police and the forest department to catch it. It was ultimately tranquilised and taken away. This is not the first time a wild animal strayed near human habitation in the district. In November 2021, a leopard was seen roaming in the posh Raj Nagar colony, which is next to the district court. In January this year, a leopard was killed after being hit by a speeding vehicle on the Delhi Meerut Expressway near Kalcheena village of the district. Those injured in the leopard attack on Wednesday are undergoing treatment, DCP City Nipun Agarwal said.

Leopards are common around the jungles in the National Capital Region, or NCR. The police and forest department personnel took over four hours to rescue the leopard, news agency PTI reported. The rescue team managed to control the situation once the big cat returned to the ground floor. \"The two collapsible gates on either sides of the ground floor were closed to confine the animal. Once this was done, some of our teams focused on rescuing people locked inside offices and washrooms of the building,\" a police officer said. He said two lawyers and a head constable were among 10 people injured in the incident.

The decision, among others, was approved by the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) during its 76th board meeting on Monday. The approval has been done for allotment of the land to airport\\'s concessionaire Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL), a fully-owned subsidiary of Zurich International Airport AG, which has won the contract to develop the greenfield airport at Jewar, some 75 km off Delhi. \"The development work of the Noida International Airport project is being done by the concessionaire M/s Yamuna International Airport Pvt Ltd, whose concession period is 40 years. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which is under the Government of India, is responsible for security at all airports in the country. The CISF will also look after the security at the Jewar Airport,\" the YEIDA said in the statement. \"As per the airport\\'s concession agreement, the consignee has to provide residential facilities to the security forces deployed for the security of the airport. In this regard, plot number GH-03A, Sector-22A of area 55219.178 square metres has been kept aside from e-auction for the residence of CISF and it has been decided to allot the land to concessionaire YIAPL under group housing category at a cost of 15 per cent in addition to the prevailing rate at the time of land allotment,\" it stated.

The YEIDA also said it has decided to fix the standards for the building and activities to be constructed under the airport by including \"aviation chapter\" in the building bylaws. This addition has been done over requests of the concessionaire of the Noida International Airport, said the YEIDA, which manages land along the 165-km-long Yamuna Expressway and functions under the Industrial Development Ministry of the Uttar Pradesh government. The authority has also decided to acquire more land around the upcoming airport, whose first phase is expected to be completed by September 2024. \"In view of construction of peripheral road from industrial sectors adjacent to Noida International Airport such as sectors 21, 28, 29, 32, 33, 10, 09, construction of connecting road in the North East and West sides of the airport and in view of possibilities of future encroachment, it has been decided to purchase land up to 500 metres, including roads, with mutual consent for acquisition of land,\" it said. The YEIDA is a 12.50 per cent stakeholder in the Noida International Airport.

       "  'Police said a challan campaign will begin from Friday. (File) Starting Friday, private vehicles registered in Noida and Gautam Buddh Nagar but not having a high-security registration plate (HSRP) will be penalised Rs 5,000 as per law, police said on Thursday. According to officials, the HSRP was introduced by the central government and vide a notification in December 2018 made mandatory on commercial and non-commercial vehicles manufactured or registered after April 1, 2019. A deadline was also set for the implementation of the HSRP, ending on February 15, 2023, they said. “The time period provided for installing high-security registration plates on vehicles was February 15 and it has ended now. Accordingly, the Gautam Buddh Nagar Traffic police and the local police at thana levels will start a campaign to take action against vehicles not having HSRP, holding them liable for faulty number plates,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Anil Yadav said. “The challan amount in such cases will be Rs 5,000. Hence, it is my request to everyone to please apply for the HSRP if you have not already done it, and get it installed immediately in your vehicles,” DCP Yadav said. The officer told PTI that the challan campaign will begin from Friday. According to Gautam Buddh Nagar transport department officials, there are over 8.70 lakh registered vehicles in the district, of which around 6 lakh have the HSRP. The police warning for HSRP comes in the wake of Uttar Pradesh Transport and Road Safety Director Anupam Kulshreshtha writing to police chiefs of all 75 districts of the state for it. In his letter, issued earlier this month, Mr Kulshreshtha had said that not having HSRP is an offence under the Motor Vehicle Act, besides many times such vehicles are used in criminal activities. Hence there is a need for ensuring high-security registration plates in all vehicles, he added.

       "  'Members of the Vaishya Samaj Seva Samiti submitted a memorandum against Dinesh Khatik. Members of the Vaishya community on Friday sought an apology from Uttar Pradesh minister Dinesh Khatik for allegedly insulting them and trying to divide Hindu society. A controversy had erupted after Mr Khatik, the state Jal Shakti minister, on October 4 allegedly said he was not a baniya\\'s (the trading caste) son in a derogatory way. Mr Khatik had gone to Parikshitgarh to meet the family members of Deepak Tyagi who was beheaded last week by a man as he suspected him of being in a relationship with his daughter. As he was addressing people gathered there, someone interrupted Mr Khatik who lost his cool and responded, \"Don\\'t be arrogant, I may have become an MLA but still belong to the village. I am neither from the city nor a baniya\\'s son (baniye ki aulad)\". After a clip of the incident went viral on social media, several Vaishya community members, including BJP leaders, condemned Mr Khatik and sought his apology. Members of the Vaishya Samaj Seva Samiti submitted a memorandum against Mr Khatik to the DM and staged protest, saying if the minister cannot respect the community, then he need not insult it. State convener of BJP trade cell Vineet Kumar Agarwal Sharda too hit out at the minister, accusing him of attempting to divide Hindus. The minister has insulted the Vaishya community and he is working to divide Hindus. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath should intervene in this matter, he said. What the British could not do, the minister (Khatik) is doing, Sharda said and demanded an apology from the minister. Meanwhile, Mr Khatik played down the controversy and said his statement was distorted by some people who want to malign his image. Mr Khatik said he respected all communities and there was no question of hurting anyone\\'s sentiments.

       "  'Further investigation into the matter is underway. The Cyber Crime wing of Uttar Pradesh Police on Friday said it has arrested one person in connection with a Rs 1.84-crore cryptocurrency fraud. The Mumbai-based accused was arrested by officers of the Cyber Crime police station, Noida, for allegedly duping a Meerut-based businessman on the pretext of investment in cryptocurrency. During the probe, it was found that the accused allegedly misled people across the country on the pretext of cryptocurrency trading through a fake website and cheated them of crores of rupees. Officials said several such cases of people being duped on the pretext of online crypto trading through fake websites have come to light across the country. In his FIR, Meerut-based Yogendra Kumar Chaudhary alleged that he was defrauded of Rs 1.84 crore on the pretext of huge returns from crypto trading, the police said. \"During the investigation, the money was found to have been transacted into 19 bank accounts and one payment aggregator. After analysing the data, the role of Bhuleshwarnath Mishra (59) came to light and he was arrested,\" the police said. \"The suspect lives in Hiranandani Heritage in Kandiwali East, Mumbai. He informed the investigation team that he worked on commission for a Singapore-based foreigner who claimed to be a crypto trading advisor,\" the police added. Mr Mishra\\'s role was to transfer the money from his bank account to Binance Crypto Exchange and convert it into USDT (Tether) -- a popular stablecoin used by crypto enthusiasts for years to leverage their trades -- so that the funds could become accessible to his Singapore-based associate. The website used to dupe the complainant was www.gicsingapore.com. The operators provided small profits on Mishra\\'s initial few investments, Noida Cyber Crime police station in-charge Reeta Yadav said. \"They first lured him by showing profits on his crypto trading account on the website and he realised the fraud only after having invested Rs 1,84,70,000,\" Ms Yadav said. While further investigation is underway, the police have cautioned the public to be careful during online transactions and use the dedicated helpline number 1930 to report any cyber offence.

       "  'Varun Gandhi is BJP\\'s Lok Sabha member from Pilibhit in Uttar Pradesh. \"As Agniveers don\\'t have the right to pension, I am ready to give up my pension rights too,\" tweeted BJP MP Varun Gandhi on Friday morning, in the latest in a string of statements against the Agnipath defence recruitment and other moves by his party\\'s government. The Agnipath scheme has elicited protests across the country as it provides for only four years of service, after which at least 75 per cent of the recruits (or \\'Agniveers\\') will be let go without pensionary benefits. अल्पावधि की सेवा करने वाले अग्निवीर पेंशन के हकदार नही हैं तो जनप्रतिनिधियों को यह ‘सहूलियत\\' क्यूँ?राष्ट्ररक्षकों को पेन्शन का अधिकार नही है तो मैं भी खुद की पेन्शन छोड़ने को तैयार हूँ।क्या हम विधायक/सांसद अपनी पेन्शन छोड़ यह नही सुनिश्चित कर सकते कि अग्निवीरों को पेंशन मिले? Varun Gandhi, a grandson of former prime minister Indira Gandhi and BJP\\'s member of Lok Sabha from Pilibhit in Uttar Pradesh, tweeted in Hindi, saying, \"If the Agniveers who serve for a short time are not eligible for pension, then why this \\'facility\\' to public representatives...\\xa0Can we, MLAs and MPs, not give up our pensions so that Agniveers get pension?\" The Lok Sabha website says every person who has served as a member of either House of Parliament for any period is entitled to pension of Rs 20,000/- per month. \"Where any person has served the Parliament for a period exceeding five years, he/she shall be entitled for an additional pension at Rs. 1,500/- per month for every year in excess of five years,\" it adds. The Agniveers are entitled to a take-home starting salary of Rs 21,000 a month, while they will get around Rs 12 lakh once released after the four-year service. The latest tweet by Varun Gandhi,\\xa0whose mother Maneka Gandhi has served as a minister under PM Narendra Modi,\\xa0comes soon after he took jabs at the central government on several issues. On June 20, he hit out at his party\\'s MLA for calling ‘Agnipath\\' protesters “jihadis”.\\xa0Two days before that, he took\\xa0a swipe at the Centre over the scheme, saying it is not appropriate for a sensitive government to \"strike first and think later\". Before that, after Prime Minister Modi\\'s office announced 10 lakh recruitments in the government \"in mission mode\", Varun Gandhi\\'s message of \"thanks\" was seen by many as a thinly veiled dig.\\xa0He had said there are \"more than 1 crore \\'sanctioned but vacant\\' posts\". \"To fulfill the promise of providing 2 crore jobs every year, steps will have to be taken at a faster pace,\"\\xa0his tweet read.

       "  'Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Jayant Chaudhary says government made rash decision. (File) Urging the protesters to shun violence and get organised so that the government hears them clearly, Rajya Sabha member Jayant Chaudhary said on Friday that the Agnipath scheme will have to be rolled back. \"That\\'s the only rational choice,\" said the Rashtriya Lok Dal leader, a prominent opposition figure with support base in western Uttar Pradesh, a major catchment area for armed forces\\' recruitment. Speaking with NDTV, Mr Chaudhary said the government needs to be sensitive in how it handles the protesting aspirants \"who feel hopeless now\".\\xa0\"There has been no army recruitment since 2019. Young people were already frustrated and the four-year hiring scheme has made it worse,\" said Mr Chaudhary, part of an alliance led by Samajwadi Party\\'s Akhilesh Yadav. \"In the villages, people say \\'no one will marry our sons now\\'... (as) these are not permanent jobs,\" he replied, when asked about the mood of his region. \"People are saying that the government was delaying recruitment on purpose, as it was planning this scheme all along. The government\\xa0thought there will be more desperate aspirants because of the long gap, and there will be a groundswell of support once the scheme comes. The opposite has happened.\" The scheme, announced on June 14, is for hiring young men and women aged 17.5 to 21 for all three services for four years, after which up to 25 per cent may be absorbed for regular commission of 15 years. The government has raised the upper age limit to 23 for this year as there have been no recruitments for two years owing to the Covid pandemic. \"Even the parameters of how they\\'ll select the 25 per cent to be retained — those are not clear,\" the RLD leader said. \"The government plans to hire around 40,000 recruits this year under the scheme; so basically only about 10,000 will get permanent jobs, that too in another four years. Compare this to 2019, when 80,000 were hired for regular commission directly.\" Calling the scheme a result of \"rash decision-making,\" he said, \"Look at the distressing signals we are sending to China.\" On whether the reported logic of this being a cost-cutting scheme made sense - no data has been given on what and how much the government will save - Jayant Chaudhary said, \"Don\\'t give them ideas; they will come up with some propaganda.\" In an appeal in Hindi to the protesters, he told them, \"Hum sab aapke saath hain, sarkar ke upar aap ka haq hai. (We are all with you; you have a right over the government too). You must have patience and get organised. If you stop the violence, you will be heard much better.\" \"Even the common people understand that you have been wronged. But vandalism will make people lose faith in you,\" he said. Meanwhile, in Telangana\\'s Secunderabad,\\xa0a 19-year-old man died and over 15 were injured as violent protests against the new military recruitment policy spread to the southern state after entering the third consecutive day in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana.

       "  'Police seen using lathis on protesters before arresting them in Prayagraj. The Uttar Pradesh Police were seen using lathis to hit protesters before arresting them today in Prayagraj, where a demonstration was held in parts of the city against remarks made by BJP representatives about Prophet Muhammad after Friday prayers. Prayagraj, one of the Uttar Pradesh\\'s largest cities, saw stone-throwing and the police cracking down on protesters by lathicharges and using tear gas to disperse mobs. Videos emerging later in the day showed police using lathis on the protesters before pushing them into buses to arrest them. Some protesters were seen trying to flee the police action. Police were seen telling media not to cover the happenings. These events took place after at least two hours of unrest where stones were thrown on policemen, and a few vehicles partly burned as they tried to contain the violence. Some police personnel were injured too. Senior police officials said the situation was now under control but still tense. The remarks on Prophet Muhammad by since-suspended BJP national spokesperson Nupur Sharma and since-expelled Delhi BJP leader Naveen Jindal triggered an international row. Friday saw protests in parts of several cities across India, including Delhi, Ranchi, Saharanpur and Moradabad. The demonstrations in Delhi took place outside the Jama Masjid, one of the largest mosques in India, after the Friday prayers. Protesters demanded the arrest of Nupur Sharma and dispersed after about an hour. Protests were also held in Kolkata, Hyderabad, Ludhiana, Ahmedabad, Navi Mumbai and several areas in Srinagar. In other places like Lucknow, Kanpur and Firozabad, police tightened security. The controversial comments during a TV debate and on Twitter had angered Muslims in India and abroad. Several West Asian countries demanded a public apology, summoned Indian envoys and saw calls for a boycott of Indian products. India tried to defuse the row calling the comments \"views of fringe elements\". Legal action came after two weeks on Thursday, when Delhi Police filed a complaint against Ms Sharma and Mr Jindal but also named Hyderabad-based politician Asaduddin Owaisi, journalist Saba Naqvi and others for \"inciting people on divisive lines\" and provoking riots.

Both the Taj Mahal and the Agra fort have been served notices for outstanding bills by various units of the Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government. The ASI has been asked to pay more than Rs 1 crore in \"dues\". Three notices have been received so far, two for the Taj Mahal and one for the Agra Fort, ASI\\'s superintending archaeologist in Agra, Raj Kumar Patel, confirmed to NDTV. \"For the Taj Mahal, we have got two notices, one for property tax and the other from the water supply department that has 12 points. A total of 1 crore plus rupees has been demanded from the ASI,\" Dr Patel told NDTV. The official said it had to be an error as such taxes don\\'t apply for monuments. \"First of all, property tax or house tax is not applicable to monument premises. Uttar Pradesh laws have this provision too and so do other states. As for the water notice, in the past no such demand has been made and we do not have any water connection that we use for any commercial purposes. The lawns that we maintain inside the Taj complex are for public service and there is no question of dues,\" Dr Patel said. The Agra fort, a UNESCO world heritage site built by the Mughal emperor Akbar, was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was moved from Agra to Delhi. This historic monument has also received a five-crore rupee tax demand, according to ASI officials. \"The cantonment board had served us notice for the Agra fort, a world heritage monument - a total of over Rs 5 crore. We have replied to them that the concerned government Act exempts monuments,\" Dr Patel said. The Times of India quoted a senior municipal officer in Agra saying an investigation had been ordered into how the notices had been issued. The officer also said a private company was processing the notices on contract with the government.

       "  'Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann also involved in a tussle with Punjab\\'s Governor Banwarilal Purohit. Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann Monday accused BJP leaders, including former chief minister Amarinder Singh, of demanding \"governor\\'s rule\" in the state and said that people know that these leaders have always been \"anti-Punjab\". The Mann-led AAP government has been under fire from the opposition which has been alleging a deteriorating law-and-order situation in the state. The chief minister\\'s also involved in a tussle with Governor Banwarilal Purohit. It worsened last week with the governor indicating that he is in no hurry to summon the Assembly\\'s Budget session, and reminding the chief minister about his \"derogatory response\" to a letter from the Raj Bhavan. Governor\\'s letter to Chief Minister Mann had come two days after the Punjab Cabinet decided to call the assembly session from March 3 and requested the governor to summon the House. \"Capt Amarinder Singh, Kewal Dhillon, Balbir Singh Sidhu, Fateh Jang Bajwa, Raj Kumar Verka, Gurpreet Kangar, Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi... all Congressmen (who are) in BJP these days can often be seen around the Governor\\'s residence. They are speaking about the governor\\'s rule in Punjab. People of Punjab know that they have always remained anti-Punjab,\" Mr Mann said in his tweet in Punjabi. AAP MP Raghav Chadha on Sunday said the Punjab government has been forced to move the Supreme Court as the Governor was not responding to the state cabinet\\'s decision of convening the budget session of the assembly. Meanwhile, Punjab BJP leader Fateh Jang Bajwa demanded the governor\\'s rule in Punjab while attacking the AAP government over various issues, including alleged deteriorating law and order in the state. \"Our party, while considering the present situation, demands that governor\\'s rule should be imposed in Punjab,\" Mr Bajwa said here on Monday and accused the AAP of not being able to run the state. He said the state government was talking about attracting investments from other states but considering the present law-and-order situation, \"there is a fear that the existing industry may leave\". Meanwhile, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal also attacked the AAP government over the law and order issue. In a statement, Mr Badal said, \"No one is safe in today\\'s Punjab.\" \"The police force has been bottled down by the AAP administration as was witnessed recently during the attack on the Ajnala police station by radicals led by Amritpal Singh. This, as well as other incidents, which have revealed the complete lack of an integrated command structure, have demoralized the state police and compounded the problem,\" he alleged. Punjab BJP leader Subhash Sharma slammed the AAP for holding protests over CBI arresting Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, stating the arrest was made on the basis of proof. SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia demanded that the CBI probe into the Delhi excise policy case be extended to Punjab, claiming Sisodia was also the \"architect\" of the Punjab excise policy which had caused \"losses of hundreds of crores to the state exchequer\". \"The actors and directors of the Punjab excise policy are the same as in the case of Delhi. As in the case of Delhi, the CBI should probe the role of senior officers and AAP politicians who had colluded to give huge benefits to select liquor manufacturers,\" Mr Majithia alleged.

Though some fissiparous forces are continuously trying to derail the peace and progress of the state, their nefarious designs will not be allowed to succeed, the chief minister said, adding no one will be allowed to disturb the hard-earned peace in the state. He reiterated that those who carried the Guru Granth Sahib to a police station in Ajnala in Amritsar as a shield cannot be called the \\'waris\\' (heir) of Punjab. His remarks came days after self-styled Sikh preacher and Khalistani sympathiser Amritpal Singh and his supporters, some of them brandishing swords and guns, broke through barricades and barged into a police station in Ajnala on the outskirts of the Amritsar city on Thursday, extracting an assurance from the police that his aide and kidnapping case accused Lovepreet Singh would be released. Amritpal heads an organisation called \\'Waris Punjab De.\" This is an unpardonable crime which must be condemned by one and all, Mr Mann was quoted as saying in an official statement. The chief minister said, \"The Guru Granth Sahib is a source of inspiration for all of us and we must take inspiration from it rather than taking cover under it for protection from unlawful activities.\" The AAP government in Punjab has come under opposition attack which has alleged that the law-and-order situation in the state has broken down. The chief minister, speaking in Gujarat\\'s Bhavnagar, said that some people funded from across the border are trying to destabilise peace and progress in Punjab. Such people are acting as puppets in the hands of Pakistan. But the Punjab Police personnel are capable of safeguarding the interests of the state and its people, Mr Mann said. He said that, earlier, parties used to seek votes on the \"divisive agenda\". However, a paradigm shift was witnessed in the political system with the entry of AAP, which forced the traditional parties to reset their agenda, Mr Mann said. He said the AAP was a party of warriors who can do anything for the well-being of the people. In mere 11 months, the AAP government has fulfilled the major guarantees promised to the people. Top priority is being accorded to health, education and employment, Mr Mann said. (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)

(Representational) Protestors allegedly snatched a teargas handgun, its ammunition and attempted to kill policemen amid raising of pro-Khalistan slogans during a violent clash with the Chandigarh Police, according to an FIR registered on Thursday. The Chandigarh Police has lodged the FIR in connection with the clash in which around 30 policemen, including the Rapid Action Force personnel, were injured while several police vehicles were damaged. The incident took place on Wednesday at Sector 52-53 at the Chandigarh-Mohali border when protestors tried to force their way to reach Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann\\'s official residence here.

The protestors seeking the release of Sikh prisoners on Wednesday had attacked police personnel and damaged a water cannon vehicle, a \"vajra\" (riot-control vehicle), two police jeeps, a fire-fighting vehicle and some other vehicles with swords and sticks. The FIR said the protestors deliberately damaged police vehicles and other police equipment. It said amid the raising of pro-Khalistan slogans, some protestors on tractors and horses attacked policemen with sticks, swords and spears with the intention to kill them. Several police personnel who sustained injuries ran to save their lives, according to the FIR. Had they (policemen) not saved their lives by running away, the protestors would have killed them, it added. As per the FIR, a tear gas handgun, ammunition from the \\'vajra\\' vehicle and several equipment lying in the vehicles of Rapid Action Force were taken away by the protestors, while around 20 police barricades were damaged. The FIR has been lodged on the complaint of Inspector Davinder Singh, the station house officer of Sector 34 police station.

       "  \" Watch: Protesters vs Cops In Chandigarh Over Sikh Prisoners' Release \",\n",
       "  'The protesters were demanding the release of Sikh prisoners. Chaos erupted in Chandigarh on Wednesday as protesters seeking the release of Sikh prisoners across the country clashed with police. The protest, organised by the Qaumi Insaaf Morcha, resulted in several injuries to around 30 police personnel and damage to police vehicles. According to officials, police had erected barricades near the Chandigarh-Mohali border to prevent the protesters from reaching the official residence of Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann. When the protesters attempted to force their way through the barricades, police used a water cannon to disperse the crowd. The protesters then attacked police personnel and damaged a water cannon vehicle, a \"vajra\" (riot control vehicle), two police jeeps, a fire-fighting vehicle, and other vehicles with swords and sticks. Director General of Police of Chandigarh, Praveer Ranjan, reported that around 25 to 30 personnel, including members of the Rapid Action Force, were injured in the attack. An FIR will be filed against those involved in the incident. The protesters were demanding the release of Sikh prisoners who they claim have completed their sentences but are still being held in prisons across the country. The demonstration was being held at the YPS Chowk near the Chandigarh-Mohali border since January 7th. Mr Ranjan stated that larger gatherings were banned in Chandigarh, and police did not allow the protesters to hold any demonstrations in the city. However, a group of protesters turned violent and attempted to jump the barricades without any provocation from police. The police chief also stated that the protesters were carrying dangerous weapons, including swords, iron rods, and sticks, which they used to attack the police personnel. Several police officers were seriously injured and were hospitalised, and stones were thrown at the police. The police chief stated that they used minimum force to control the situation and will take legal action against those involved in the violence. Qaumi Insaaf Morcha leader, Gurcharan Singh, accused the police of using excessive force against the peaceful protesters and cane charging them. He also accused the administration of trying to \"fail\" the morcha. The protesters were seeking justice for the 2015 sacrilege and police-firing incidents in Faridkot and the release of Sikh prisoners, including Balwant Singh Rajoana, a convict in the assassination of former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh, and Devinderpal Singh Bhullar, a convict in the 1993 Delhi bomb blast.

The woman, Tejashwita, has suffered injuries to her head and is recovering at a hospital. Her family said she has spoken to them and is doing fine. According to the family, the incident took place on Saturday night when Tejashwita and her mother Manjider Kaur were feeding stray dogs by the footpath. In CCTV footage, Tejashwita can be seen feeding a dog. A Mahindra Thar SUV appears on the parallel road. The SUV is seen making a U-turn and hitting the woman, leaving her writhing in pain. Tejashwita's mother was horrified to see her lying in a pool of blood. She says no one stopped to help. She called home and the police control room. Tejashwita's father, Ojaswi Kaushal, said she has completed her graduation in Architecture and is preparing for civil service entrance exams. She used to go with her mother daily to feed stray dogs, he said. Police have registered a case and search is on for the vehicle and the driver. A series of horrifying accidents have brought rash driving back under the spotlight. The most prominent among these is the Delhi car horror case, in which a 20-year-old woman died after her leg was stuck under a car and the vehicle dragged her through the roads. In another tragic incident, a speeding police van rammed into a car on the Gurugram-Faridabad road yesterday. A six-year-old girl was killed and five family members injured.

       "  'The woman has accused Haryana minister Sandeep Singh of sexual harassment The woman coach, who alleged sexual harassment by Haryana Sports Minister Sandeep Singh, on Tuesday claimed that Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has been trying to influence the probe. Speaking to the media after she appeared before the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Chandigarh Police, the woman said, \"The SIT has been formed, everything was told in detail. Haryana Chief Minister is trying to influence the investigation. The incident happened in Chandigarh...I am being pressurised to be silent.\" She claimed that she is receiving phone calls asking her to leave the country for which she has been offered Rs 1 crore. The coach further claimed that Haryana Police is putting pressure on her. \"I have told everything in detail to the Chandigarh Police SIT. I also told the pending issues to the SIT. I heard the Chief Minister\\'s statement this morning, in which the Chief Minister himself is taking the side of Sandeep Singh. Chandigarh Police did not put any pressure on me. Haryana Police is trying to put pressure on me,\" she said. \"I am receiving phone calls that I can leave and go to any country I want and I would get Rs 1 crore for a month,\" added the woman. The coach\\'s advocate Dipanshu Bansal alleged that the Chandigarh Police has not arrested the former minister, nor have the police interrogated him. \"Haryana Chief Minister made the SIT. Everything was told to SIT. Why police are not arresting Sandeep Singh. It is a non-bailable offence. Sandeep Singh was not called but she was called four times,\" Mr Bansal said. Representatives from Dhankhar Khap along with the father of the woman coach, who accused sports minister Sandeep Singh of sexual harassment, met Haryana Home minister Anil Vij in Ambala on Tuesday. Last month, the woman, who is a junior athlete coach, held a press conference at the office of the opposition Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), wherein she alleged that the minister harassed her from February to November last year, by repeated messages on social media and had touched her inappropriately and also threatened her in messages. During the press briefing, the woman demanded that the Manohar Lal Khattar government in Haryana immediately sack Sandeep Singh and set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the matter. Notably, on Sunday, the woman told ANI that she opened up about the incident to the public after her she lost patience. \"I am also a player, think how much patience I would have to tolerate such ill behaviour of this person from February till now,\" the woman said, adding that she didn\\'t open up about the incident earlier as she was afraid of negative impact on the sports industry. \"I tried as much as I could. He created such an atmosphere officially that a girl comes to him automatically,\" she added. Hours after sexual harassment allegations were levelled against him, Haryana Sports Minister Sandeep Singh on Sunday said that he has handed over the responsibility of the Sports department to Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar until the report of the investigation is out.

       "  ' \"House Full Of Smoke\": Kochi Resident 7 Days After Big Waste Plant Fire ',\n",
       "  'Some 50,000 tonnes of waste are smouldering in the Kochi fire, according to experts Several teams of firefighters are still battling massive smoke that has engulfed a solid waste management plant in Kerala\\'s Kochi. The fire has been raging for nearly a week now. Thick, black smoke has blanketed the area. The Indian Navy sent a helicopter with a large bucket dangling from it, which dumped water over the thick smoke in Kochi\\'s Brahmapuram. \"Initially, when the fire started, we were not affected much. Once the fire settled, it became very difficult for us with the massive, thick smoke. Today, even my house was full of smoke. Yesterday, my friends who live at the hostel had to sleep with masks. They were complaining of smoke and odour,\" Liz Biju, a student studying at a college just 1 km from the waste management plant told NDTV. Her house too is nearby. At least 30 teams of firefighters and navy choppers were involved in trying to put out the fire, which has ignited large mounds of garbage including plastic, metal and rubber, releasing toxic smoke. \"I appeal to the authorities to take action. We can\\'t be breathing like this,\" Liz Biju said. The fire at the sewage plant in Kochi has been raging for nearly a week Another Kochi resident, Nakul, said, \"We have been facing a lot of difficulties for a week. Yesterday, it was very severe. We were facing breathing difficulties and strong odour.\" Some 50,000 tonnes of non-degradable waste are smouldering, according to environment experts. \"What we see is fire and smoke. What we don\\'t see is huge amount of dioxide... considering around 50,000 tonnes of plastic and other non-biodegradables would have been burnt in the last one week, some 250 kg of dioxide would have been generated. It\\'s a huge catastrophe,\" said Dr CN Manoj, Managing Director of Pelican Ventures. Kerala Health Veena George has told people not to worry. \"There\\'s no need to worry. Everyone should wear mask. The elderly, people with breaking issues, babies and pregnant women should not go to places with lots of smoke. We have prepared hospitals to keep an eye on smoke-related issues,\" Ms George said. Kochi\\'s air quality index (AQI) continued to be \"poor\" even six days after the fire broke out. Kochi\\'s Brahmapuram is the only big centralised solid waste management plant in the 14 districts of Kerala. The Kerala High Court has slammed the Kochi municipal body, saying the city has become a gas chamber. It sought a report on what caused the fire and an action plan. The civic body said they are still investigating the cause of the fire. \"It has been brought to our attention that bio-mining rules were not being followed, garbage was being dumped and piled up. All aspects will be probed,\" said P Rajeev, a minister in Kerala\\'s Left government.

       "  'Additional Private Secretary of Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan Raveendran today appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on the second consecutive day for questioning. On Tuesday, ED interrogated Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan\\'s additional private secretary CM Raveendran for nine hours in connection with the Life Mission scam case. The interrogation started at 10.30 am and ended at 7.30 pm. On February 27, Mr Raveendran did not appear before the ED for questioning in connection with the Life Mission Scam case. On February 23, ED issued notice to Raveendran in the LIFE Mission scam case. He had informed the central agency that he cannot appear on February 27 as the legislative assembly session was underway at Thiruvananthapuram. A Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) Court had sent M Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to the Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan to judicial custody till March 8 in the LIFE Mission Scam case. On February 16, the remand report submitted by ED in the PMLA Court against M Sivasankar, former principal secretary to the Kerala CMO in the LIFE Mission Scam Case, revealed some WhatsApp chats between him and other accused Swapna Suresh. The remand report alleged that there is a larger nexus involving government representatives in the allocation of contracts and the generation of proceeds of crime via the upfront commission as a bribe. \"In his WhatsApp message sent to Swapna on July 31, 2019, Sivasankar warned Swapna to be very careful and asked to take care. In his WhatsApp message, Sivasankar told Swapna not to get involved and warned her that if something goes wrong, they would put blame on her. He also told Swapna to keep away from the process to which Swapna replied that she would give it to Sarith and Khalid (other suspects in the case). Sivasankar also told Swapna that CM had asked him to get a job for Swapna,\" the remand report had read. The report further said that the material evidence such as the WhatsApp conversation between Swapna Suresh and Sivasankar and the statement given by Suresh, it is clearly indicating that there is a larger nexus involving government representatives in the allocation of contracts and generation of proceeds of crime via the upfront commission as a bribe.

       "  \"Pinarayi Vijayan's additional private secretary C M Raveendran appeared before the ED. (File) Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's additional private secretary C M Raveendran on Tuesday appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which has been probing an alleged violation of the Foreign Contribution (Regulations) Act in the Life Mission, a flagship housing project of the state government. The agency had earlier asked Mr Raveendran to appear before it on February 27, but he cited official duties for not appearing on that day. Mr Raveendran reached the ED office here around 9.30 am and the interrogation is going on. Earlier, a few media houses had released the suspected chat between Mr\\xa0 and the prime accused in the controversial gold smuggling through UAE consulate case Swapna Suresh. The agency has earlier arrested the former principal secretary to the chief minister, M Sivasankar, over his alleged involvement in the ED case. The central agency had, on February 18, interrogated U V Jose -- the former CEO of Life Mission project -- in connection with its probe. The CBI had in 2020 filed an FIR in a Kochi court under Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code and Section 35 of FCRA on a complaint by the then Wadakkanchery Congress MLA, Anil Akkara, listing Santosh Eappen, Managing Director of Unitac Builder, Kochi as the first accused and Sane Ventures as the second accused. The two companies had undertaken the construction based on the agreement entered with them by Red Crescent, an international humanitarian movement, which had agreed to provide Rs 20 crore towards the Life Mission project. The Congress has been alleging that there was corruption involved in the selection of the contractor by Red Crescent. The alleged FCRA violation and corruption in the project had snowballed into a major political issue at the time with opposition parties charging that Suresh had admitted before an NIA court that she had received Rs 1 crore as commission from the project. She had reportedly claimed that the money was meant for Sivasankar. However, the Life Mission CEO had submitted before the court that Unitac and Sane Ventures had undertaken the construction based on the agreement entered into with them by Red Crescent and had directly accepted foreign contributions from Red Crescent, which is a foreign agency. The CEO has also contended that the companies which signed an agreement with the Red Crescent do not come under the categories of persons prohibited from receiving any foreign contribution as per Section 3 of FCRA.

       "  ' \"Fake Videos Can\\'t Be...\": Kerala Chief Minister On Raids At News Channel ',\n",
       "  'Pinarayi Vijayan said making and broadcasting fake videos cannot be considered media work After Kerala Police conducted raids at the Asianet News office, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday said broadcasting fake videos cannot be considered media work adding that his government does not attack media outlets that advocate oppositional views. Addressing the state Assembly, Kerala CM said, \"In November 2022, a video was aired on the Asianet News TV channel, in which a minor girl in her uniform was introduced, which amounts to spreading the misapprehension that the government schools in Kerala are under the grip of drug abuse.\" In August 2022, the Chief Minister said the police investigations proved that a similar video prepared by using another minor girl was not based on facts. In the case of the latest incident, it was pointed out that the video was prepared by reproducing the audio of the earlier one, by using another girl and airing it. Consequent to the complaint given by MLA PV Anwar to the State police chief, about this, a case has been registered in the Vellayil Police station, Kozhikode in which the inquiry is underway, he said. Mr Vijayan further said that protests occurred in various parts of the state against the making of such a video and the misuse of a minor girl for it. The Students\\' Federation of India (SFI) workers as well have organised a protest march to the TV channel\\'s office in Ernakulam district. A case has been registered in Palarivattom Police station under sections 143, 147, 149, 447 and 506 of IPC and eight accused were arrested, apropos the complaint received from the media organisation that the protestors have gate-crashed into the office and disrupted the functioning of the office. Further investigation into the case is going on. \"The question about freedom of media does not at all arise here. The legal procedures against someone who commits a criminal offence are not initiated after checking the person\\'s occupation. The law does not allow this,\" Kerala CM stated. He said making and broadcasting fake videos cannot be considered media work. Trapping a minor girl in such an act without informing her that she is being misused and asking for protection to uphold media freedom does not at all form part of valiant media work. The majority think that such deterioration should not happen in the media field. \"Those who are asking for the privilege of protection enjoyed by the media to the criminal act of making fake videos by misusing a girl should say whether a murder will not be murder if it is committed by someone amid a news broadcasting job. Will it become a \\'holy act\\' which has the privilege of protection enjoyed by the media?\" he said. In reference to the Income Tax department survey at BBC offices, Mr Vijayan said the protest that happened here cannot be compared to the raid conducted at the BBC office. \"The raid at the BBC office was an act of revenge against the revelation by the channel about the role of a person who is in power in the Gujarat massacre. But the fake video made by a channel here (Asianet News) was not made as a revelation against any ruler or a government and it is not provoking any ruler in that sense. Hence, no resentment shall arise from any ruler against it. So the allegation of \\'revenge against media\\' won\\'t even stand here,\" said the Kerala CM. \"We do not attack media outlets that advocate oppositional views. But both the Congress and BJP regularly follow this practice of silencing media,\" CM Vijayan added. Attacking the Congress, Mr Vijayan said seven foreign reporters were expelled from the country, 250 journalists were jailed and 54 people were denied accreditation. \"This is the so-called Congress style. Even media persons were labelled as terrorists to hunt them down. This is the history of Congress,\" he said. The crime branch police team raided the Asianet News office, one of the leading news channels in Malayalam, based on a complaint by MLA PV Anvar. The channel telecasted a report titled \\'Narcotics is a dirty business \\' on November 10. The MLA alleged this report is fabricated and submitted a written complaint to DGP. Based on this, the police registered a case naming four people from Asianet as accused. Two days back SFI activists had barged into the Asianet office in Kochi. Today\\'s raid by crime branch Assistant Commissioner V. Suresh and seven cops is a continuation of the incidents. A case was registered under sections of POCSO and the Indian Penal Code. Following the raids, Asianet News Executive Editor Sindhu Sooryakumar on Sunday said in a statement that the channel \"will do free and fair journalism without fear\" adding that it will cooperate with the investigation process. \"Asianet news will cooperate with any investigation as per law. The investigation is against a story as part of the campaign against the drugs mafia which is gaining strength. There are allegations in the FIR that attempts to defame the image of government were made,\" Sindhu Sooryakumar said.

       "  \" Muslim Couple In Kerala To Remarry Under Special Marriage Act. Here's Why \",\n",
       "  'Speaking to a TV channel, C Shukkur said: \"We just want to secure our daughters\\' future.\" A Muslim couple in Kerala\\'s Kasaragod district are going to take their wedding vows again under the Special Marriage Act (SMA) for ensuring the financial security of their three daughters. Advocate and actor C Shukkur, known for his role as a lawyer in the Kunchacko Boban starrer \\'Nna Thaan Case Kodu\\' (Sue me then), is going to remarry his wife Sheena -- former Pro-Vice Chancellor of Mahatma Gandhi University -- on International Women\\'s Day on March 8. In western countries and among some Hindu castes, couples often renew their vows or get remarried to their spouses after a certain number of years together in marital life, but this couple will be taking a special route to re-register their marriage due to certain conditions imposed in Muslim inheritance laws. The laws state that daughters will only get two-thirds of their father\\'s property and the rest will go to his brothers in the absence of a male heir. The couple, who have been married for 29 years now, hope to change the situation by re-registering their marriage under the SMA. In a Facebook post, Mr Shukkur said that in the past he had two near-death experiences which prompted him to think about what he was leaving back for his daughters and whether they would inherit all of his savings and property. His concern was that according to the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act of 1937 and the stand taken by the courts, only two-thirds of the father\\'s property goes to the daughters and the rest would go to his brothers if there was no male progeny. Moreover, under Sharia law, leaving behind a will is not permitted, he said in his post. Therefore, just because they were born as girls, they will face such gender discrimination, he pointed out. According to Mr Shukkur, the only way out of this predicament is to get married under the SMA. So he hopes that his decision would show the way to end the gender discrimination faced by daughters in Muslim families and help to raise the self-confidence and dignity of girl children. \"May Allah raise the self-confidence and dignity of our daughters. All are equal before Allah and our Constitution,\" he said in his post. He further said, in his post, that this decision of theirs to get remarried was not to defy anyone or anything or the Sharia law as it exists presently. \"We are only exploring the possibility that Muslim personal law will not affect those who marry through the Special Marriage Act. Sheena and I are remarrying for our children,\" he said. Speaking to a TV channel, he said: \"We just want to secure our daughters\\' future.\" His wife, who too spoke to the channel, said the difficulty they had gone through is faced by many Muslim families who have only daughters. \"When teaching at college or while speaking at some public forum, after it gets over, many parents come to me and ask whether this (the inheritance issue) is right. \"We have been hearing this for years. We could ask someone to do something about it or we have two options -- take the legal route or show the way through our life choices. We should do what we can,\" Ms Sheena said. The couple, whose nikah took place on October 6, 1994, will get remarried on March 8 at a Sub-Registrar\\'s office at Kanhangad in Hosdurg taluk of Kasaragod district in the presence of their daughters, according to Mr Shukkur\\'s Facebook post.

       "  'A single Bench of Justice PV Kunhikrishnan passed the order. (Representational) The Kerala High Court today dismissed the bail plea of Sunil NS, popularly known as Pulsar Suni, the prime accused in the 2017 actress assault case. A single Bench of Justice PV Kunhikrishnan passed the order. Offences under Sections 120 (B), 109, 342, 366, 354, 354B, 357, 376D, 201, and 212 read with Section 34 of the IPC and Sections 66 A and 66 E of the IT act were charged against Suni, who is in jail for the past six years. He had earlier approached the High Court for bail in March 2022. The same bench had on March 29, 2022, rejected the plea. When he approached the Supreme Court against this, it also rejected the same and directed him to approach the High Court if the trial has not concluded in a reasonable time. In the plea, Sunil contended, \"There is absolutely no chance of the trial being concluded in the near future. The applicant has not moved any other court seeking the same relief and shall not move a similar application during the pendency of this application. The petitioner is not in a position to defend his case properly by consulting and discussing with his lawyer, since he is not on bail and is not being produced in court every day. The basic right of the applicant to defend his case properly itself is defeated.\" The case pertains that, the actress, who worked in Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu films, was allegedly abducted and molested inside her car by a group of men who had forced their way into the vehicle on the night of February 17, 2017. Dileep who is a famous Malayalam actor and producer is the eighth accused in this case. There are a total of 10 accused in the case.

The raids were conducted at the office of one of the leading Malayalam news channels based on a complaint by MLA PV Anvar. \"Kerala Chief Minister is proving that he is \\'Modi in dhoti\\'.

       "  \"The ED report contained allegations against Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan (File) The Kerala assembly proceedings were again disrupted on Tuesday following an Enforcement Directorate (ED) remand report, containing certain allegations against Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, in the Life Mission case being read out in the House by the opposition UDF. The remand report was read out by Congress MLA Mathew Kuzhalnadan during discussion of the adjournment notice moved by him regarding the Life Mission case in which the Chief Minister's former principal secretary, M Sivasankar, was facing a probe by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The ED is investigating the alleged violation of the Foreign Contribution (Regulations) Act in the Life Mission, a flagship housing project of the Left government. Mr Kuzhalnadan contended that according to the report, Mr Sivasankar told the central agency that there was a meeting between him, the Chief Minister, the UAE consul general and Swapna Suresh -- an accused in the gold smuggling through diplomatic bags case. He further contended that as per the report, Mr Sivasankar has said that he briefed the Mr Vijayan after Ms Suresh was appointed to the post of Operations Manager in the Space Park project under the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Ltd. Mr Kuzhalnadan asked, in the House, whether the Chief Minister can deny these allegations in the report to which Mr Vijayan responded by categorically denying that anything as read out by the legislator ever happened. To this, the Congress MLA questioned why the Chief Minister was not moving the court against such a wrong remand report and Mr Vijayan responded that he does not need legal advice from Mr Kuzhalnadan regarding steps to take. During the questions posed by the Congress MLA to the Chief Minister and after Mr Vijayan's reply, several ruling front lawmakers left their seats and created an uproar in the House by trying to shout down Mr Kuzhalnadan. State Law Minister P Rajeeve initially said Kuzhalnadan should table in the House the contents of the document he was reading from and later contended that a remand report being considered by a court cannot be discussed in the assembly. Mr Kuzhalnadan, thereafter, said he was willing to table the remand report and sought permission of the Chair to do so. However, the shouting match between the opposition and ruling front MLAs continued and Speaker A N Shamseer was forced to briefly adjourn the House. The assembly proceedings were disrupted on Monday too following heated exchanges between the ruling Left front and the opposition UDF on an adjournment motion by the latter to discuss the alleged police brutality recently against youth wing workers of the Congress and IUML. The CBI had in 2020 filed an FIR in a Kochi court under Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code and Section 35 of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) on a complaint by the then Wadakkanchery Congress MLA Anil Akkara listing Santosh Eappen, Managing Director of Unitac Builder, Kochi as the first accused and Sane Ventures as the second accused. The two companies had undertaken the construction based on the agreement entered with them by Red Crescent, an international humanitarian movement, which had agreed to provide Rs 20 crore towards the Life Mission project. The Congress has been alleging that there was corruption involved in the selection of the contractor by Red Crescent. The alleged FCRA violation and corruption in the project had snowballed into a major political issue at that time with opposition parties charging that Swapna Suresh had admitted before an NIA court that she had received Rs 1 crore as commission from the project. She had reportedly claimed that the money was meant for Mr Sivasankar. However, the Life Mission CEO had submitted before the Kochi court that Unitac and Sane Ventures had undertaken the construction based on the agreement entered into with them by Red Crescent and had directly accepted foreign contributions from Red Crescent, which is a foreign agency. The CEO has also contended that the companies which signed an agreement with the Red Crescent do not come under the categories of persons prohibited from receiving any foreign contribution as per Section 3 of FCRA.

       "  'Pinarayi Vijayan called Manish Sisodia\\'s arrest a blatant abuse of power. (File) Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday lashed out at the BJP over the arrest of AAP leader and Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, and said the central agencies were being used to intimidate the opposition parties and termed it as an attack on democracy. Mr Vijayan said the Centre was attempting to destabilise the opposition-ruled State governments in the country and termed it as a move to divert the attention from the issues of joblessness and economic crisis. The arrest of @msisodia by CBI is another example of how @BJP4India misuses the Union Government\\'s agencies to intimidate the opposition. It\\'s a blatant abuse of power and an attack on democracy. Such repression undermines the very foundation of our nation and should be resisted. \"The arrest of @msisodia by CBI is another example of how @BJP4India misuses the Union Government\\'s agencies to intimidate the opposition. It\\'s a blatant abuse of power and an attack on democracy. Such repression undermines the very foundation of our nation and should be resisted,\" Mr Vijayan tweeted. The CBI had on Sunday arrested Mr Sisodia in connection with alleged corruption in the now-scrapped excise policy. \"There is a growing discontent among the people over joblessness and the economic crisis in the country. It seems like the Union government is trying to divert attention from such major issues through arrests like this,\" the Chief Minister\\'s Office said in a statement. Mr Vijayan urged the people to show strong protests against attacks on the country\\'s constitution and democracy.

       "  ' Kerala 1st State To Use Robotic Scavengers To Clean Manholes ',\n",
       "  'The machine has sensors that can detect harmful gases inside the manholes. The Kerala government on Friday launched robotic scavenger, Bandicoot, to clean sewages in this temple town, becoming the first state in the country to use robotic technology to clean all its commissioned manholes. Water Resources Minister, Roshi Augustine, launched Bandicoot under the Guruvayur Sewerage Project in Thrissur district by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA), as part of the 100-day action plan of the state government. \"With the launch of the project in Guruvayur, manual scavenging in Kerala has ended. Now Kerala has become the first state in the country to use robotic scavengers to clean manholes,\" the Minister claimed in a release. The robotic Tron Unit, which is the major component of Bandicoot, enters the manhole and removes sewage using robotic hands, similar to a man\\'s limbs, the release, adding that the machine has waterproof, HD vision cameras and sensors that can detect harmful gases inside the manholes. Bandicoot, developed by Kerala-based Genrobotics, had recently bagged \\'Kerala Pride\\' award at the Huddle Global 2022 conclave organised by Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM). Inaugurating the robotic scavenger in Guruvayur Municipality, Augustine said it was a major step towards use of technology-driven solutions for manhole cleaning across the state. \"With the deployment of Bandicoot in Guruvayur, all the commissioned manholes have been transformed into robotic revolution. A special team of KWA officials will be constituted for the operation of robotic cleaning in Guruvayur... The modernisation of the sewerage system will help contain the spread of epidemics and serious health challenges caused by them,\" the minister noted. At the function held at P Krishna Pillai Square here, Director of Genrobotic Innovations, Vimal Govind M K, briefed the gathering about the technology. He said Bandicoot will be cleaning all the commissioned sewerage and drainages in Kerala. Bandicoot robots are currently deployed in few towns across 17 states in India and three Union Territories. In 2018, KWA started using Bandicoot to clean the manholes in Thiruvananthapuram. Later, it was introduced in Ernakulam also, the release said. Genrobotics, a Technopark-based company, have developed \"the world\\'s first robotic scavenger\" Bandicoot in an effort to eliminate manual scavenging providing respite for workers engaged in manhole cleaning.

       "  ' Politicians, Political Parties Should Not Be Administering Temples: CPM ',\n",
       "  'CPI(M) state secretary MV Govindan said temples should not be administered by political parties. The ruling CPI(M) has said it agrees with the order of the Kerala High Court that those involved in active politics are ineligible to oversee affairs of temples. CPI(M) state secretary MV Govindan said temples should not be administered by politicians or political parties. \"That is our stand. What the High Court said is also our stand. Be it the Congress, RSS, BJP or Marxist, none of them need to be administering or presiding over temple affairs,\" he said. Mr Govindan was speaking to reporters on Wednesday in the district in between the party\\'s state-wide month-long People\\'s Defence Rally, which began from Kasaragod on Monday. The Kerala High Court had on Tuesday held that three persons -- two local CPI(M) leaders and one DYFI leader -- were ineligible to be appointed as non-hereditary trustees of the Pookkottukalikavu Temple under the Malabar Devaswom Board in Ottapalam taluk of Palakkad district. The court said the notification inviting applications for appointment of non-hereditary trustees in Pookkottukalikavu Temple clearly stipulated that those with criminal cases registered against them or working in active politics were ineligible for the post. \"So persons who are actively involved in politics, whether or not they hold any post in a political party are ineligible,\" the court had said. The order had come on a plea moved by some persons challenging the appointment of the three persons as trustees in the temple. One of the appointees, who was a local office-bearer in DYFI -- the youth wing of CPI(M) -- contended that he was not ineligible for appointment as trustee as DYFI was not a political organisation. He had also contended that members of DYFI can work in any political party. The high court rejected the contention. \"...it is stated that a member of the DYFI can work in any political party. That does not mean that the DYFI does not have any political colour,\" the court had said. \"Whether or not it has any affiliation to any particular political party, what is evident from the constitution of DYFI is that the area of activities of DYFI is politics and related activities. As such it cannot be said that the activities of DYFI are non-political,\" the court further said. Here, however, Mr Govindan differed with the high court as he was of the view that DYFI was not a political organisation. He contended that DYFI was a youth outfit and had no political affiliations.

       "  \" Kerala High Court Rejects Actor Mohanlal's Plea In Illegal Ivory Case \",\n",
       "  'Four elephant tusks were seized from Mohanlal\\'s house in 2012 The Kerala High Court on Wednesday dismissed actor Mohanlal\\'s plea against a trial court order rejecting the state government\\'s move to withdraw prosecution proceedings against him in a case related to illegal possession of ivory tusks. Justice A Badharudeen was of the view that an accused in a case \"have no right to challenge an order refusing withdrawal of prosecution\" since the said procedure is the prerogative of the prosecution. The court, however, also set aside the trial court order and directed it to consider afresh the state government\\'s plea to withdraw prosecution in the case. \"...the prayer for withdrawal of prosecution of the present case sought for by the government requires reconsideration by the trial court,\" the high court said. It directed the parties to appear before the trial court on March 3. \"There shall be a direction to the trial court to hear and pass fresh orders as expeditiously as possible from the date of receipt of copy of this order, at any rate within a period of six months,\" the high court said. The state government had sought withdrawal of the prosecution contending that it would be a futile exercise and wastage of the court\\'s time. The magisterial court, in its June 2022 order, indicated that it was not inclined to grant the prayer as the withdrawal petition was filed in a hasty manner without addressing the challenges raised before the High Court regarding legality of the ownership certificate issued to Mohanlal. The state government had on February 7, 2020 extended consent for withdrawal from prosecution in this case. The trial court, in its order, had noted that there was no gazette notification in this case and hence the alleged certificate of ownership of the tusks has no legal sanctity and was void ab initio. Four elephant tusks were seized from the actor\\'s house in a raid conducted by the Income Tax authorities in June 2012, following which a case was registered against him. The complainant had alleged that the top actor had used his clout to bury the case without any further investigation.

March 9 is observed as World Kidney Day. The World Transplant Games, organised by the World Transplant Games Federation, are aimed at raising public awareness on the importance and benefits of organ donation. Recognised by the International Olympic Committee, the event\\xa0brings together tissue and organ transplant recipients and donors from across the world. The biennial games - first held in 1978 in Portsmouth - had less than 100 participants from only five countries. The 2019 edition, held from August 17 to 23, saw more than 2,237 athletes from 60 nations in action. Some of the categories in the tournament are swimming, athletics, cycling, archery, golf, badminton, squash and table tennis. Apart from the boy and his donor mother, city-based neurosurgeon Arjun Srivatsa (57), his donor younger brother Anil Srivatsa (56), an entrepreneur, and Souvik Sarkar (35), a MNC employee are part of the 31-member group representing India at the WTG to be held from April 15 to April 21. The 31 participants include 20 kidney recipients, three heart and one liver recipient. The Srivatsa siblings made India proud by winning gold at the WTG 2019 held at Newcastle in the U.K. While Dr. Arjun won the golf gold in the receiver category, Mr. Anil excelled in ball throwing in the donor category. In September 2014, Mr. Anil had donated his kidney to Dr. Arjun, after the latter suffered from chronic renal failure. “We hope to get back with a gold this time too and have been preparing for it,” Dr. Arjun said. Varun, a 7th standard student, was diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) when he was just nine. “It was painful to watch our little one undergo very dialysis and innumerable hospital stays. It soon reached a point where a kidney transplant was imminent. He got a new lease of life following his mother’s kidney donation,” said his father Anand Anantharaman.\\xa0“Post-transplant also he had multiple struggles including NODAT (New Onset Diabetes After Transplant) and several rejection episodes. But under the care of his nephrologist Saumil Gaur, Varun’s health improved, diabetes reversed, and he is able to lead a relatively normal life.” “As Varun grew up, he discovered a love for racquet sports. He finds table tennis, badminton, tennis etc. challenging and exhilarating, so works hard to excel in these sports and to keep himself fit,” he said. Although some organisations are sponsoring the players, none of the participants from Bengaluru have any funding. Chennai-based Sumeer Kumar P, a former professional cricketer and transplant athlete, who is one among the 31 participants from India, said, “Not all of us have got sponsors. Apart from meeting physical challenges, we are also struggling with lack of funds. While contingents from other countries participate in the WTG with support of their respective governments, we have to self-fund. The government should get involved like they do with other sporting events.” Sunayana Singh, Chief Executive Officer of ORGAN (Organ Receiving and Giving Awareness Network) Parashar Foundation, which is the member organisation for the WTG Federation and the official team managers from India, said the Parashar Foundation and Mumbai-based Dinesh Vyas Trust are the main sponsors for the Indian participants.

       "  'To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US March 08, 2023 09:30 pm | Updated 09:31 pm IST - Bengaluru COMMents SHARE READ LATER The rules say that to get admissions for class 1, students have to be of six years and hence, any student who falls short of the age is being asked to repeat a grade.\\xa0\\n| Photo Credit: Special arrangement As the admission season approaches, parents of children who are currently in pre-kindergarten classes are up in arms as school managements are asking them to repeat a year to abide with the New Education Policy (NEP) and Right To Education (RTE) rules. The rules say that to get admissions for class 1, students have to be of six years and hence, any student who falls short of the age is being asked to repeat a grade. The rule will be applicable to the students who will be joining class 1 from 2025 onwards. “The school is saying that as of June 1 2026, my son should be six years old to join first grade. They are not allowing even one day delay (for those who have their birthdays in June itself). The school had a meeting, but it was inconclusive. I think my son should mostly repeat pre-kg now. There is no clarity yet,” said Sudha P., a resident of Chikkalasandra. The parents also questioned why schools accepted admissions for children who were under the prescribed age for pre-kg, if they knew a rule like this existed. As the fee structure for pre-kg is also similar to that of kindergarten classes, parents are also worried about double expenditure. “We are demanding that they exempt the children\\xa0who’ve already taken admission, and implement it from next year. The school is not agreeing and is blaming the government, whereas the government has left it to schools to decide if a grade should be repeated. It is a waste of a whole academic year and the fees we paid,” said Chaitra Prakash, a parent from Subramanyapura. A few parents also shared concerns about how the students who have to repeat a grade will feel left back when their friends who are above the age bar proceed to the next class. “Children these days are very sensitive and observant. Making them repeat just because they fall short a few days or a few weeks does not make much sense,” a parent remarked. However, government officials are firm on the decision that students should be of four years of age when they join LKG, five years when they join UKG and six years old by the time they start first grade. “The rules in the RTE clearly says that they should begin LKG at four years of age. As the decision was taken mid year, the government has provided relaxation to a few batches until 2025. Pre-kg is neither a formal class nor regulated by us. Even LKG and UKG is informal, but registered,” said Vishal R., Commissioner, Department of Public Instruction. He also confirmed that there is no compulsion for parents to make their children repeat pre-kg, LKG or UKG and instead make them join for the eligible grade the next academic year.

The Karnataka School Examination and Assessment Board (KSEAB) has modified the blueprint of all the subjects. The questions will be asked according to the blueprint, said Prasanna Kumar, Senior Assistant Director (examination), KSEAB. The KSEAB is conducting the II PU and class 10 exams for the first time. The II PU exams will be held from March 9 to 29 and class 10 examinations will be held from March 31 to April 15. Addressing students and parents in a live chat with The Hindu on Tuesday, March 7, as part of #ThtalksBengaluru series, he said, “Due to Covid-19 and the lockdown, students are facing learning backwardness since two years and it has impacted their writing skills. Therefore, we have modified the blueprint and question paper and we increased the number of objective type questions up to 20 marks. It will help in writing the examination and scoring,” he said. Answering questions from students about the blueprint, he said, “The II PU results in Karnataka does not exceed 62% pass percentage every year. At the same time, because of more objective type and MCQs, the class 12 results are more than 90% in the neighbouring States and in central board institutions. Therefore, we adopted this model to improve the II PU results in the State and modified the blueprint and question paper. Earlier, this method was adopted for class 10 students in the State.” All necessary arrangements have been made for the smooth conduct of class 10 and II PU examinations, Mr. Prasanna Kumar said, adding that tight police security will be maintained at all examination centers, CCTV camera surveillance will be deployed at the main gates and corridors of all the centers. All types of electronic devices, including mobile phones, smart watches, earphones are prohibited in the examination centers. The use of mobile phones is prohibited for officers and staff involved in security work and examination duty in examination centres. Only the superintendent of the examination centre will be allowed to use basic mobile phones without camera facility. The wall clock system will be made available for students to keep track of time at the centres, and 5% grace marks will be given for any two subjects for II PU and 10% grace marks will be given for any three subjects for class 10 students, he added. “To avoid malpractices, we have appointed 1,109 Joint Chiefs, 1,109 answer books custodians, 96 district squads, 550 taluk squads and 2,500 special squads for II PU exams, and, 6,614 squads will be appointed for class 10 exams. Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation and Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) and other corporations will provide free bus service for the students. The students can travel free of cost by showing their ID cards and admission cards on the day of the examination,” Mr. Prasanna Kumar explained. Asked about Covid-19 protocols and precautions against influenza, he said, “There are no instructions from the Health department about Covid-19. Therefore, this year, there are no Covid-19 protocols in the examination centers. If the health department will issue any precautionary measures about influenza, we will follow.” About the demand to allow hijab in the examination centres, he said, “Students should follow the dress code prescribed by the educational institutions. They can wear school or college uniforms in the examination centres and they must also follow the directions of the Supreme Court and the government on the dress code.” COMMents SHARE BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

MURALI KUMAR The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation‘s (BMTC) promotional activity of offering free bus ride to women on Wednesday to observe Women’s Day turned out to be a pleasant surprise for many of them. It was the first time the corporation in its history of 25 years offered free rides exclusively for women. “It was a pleasant surprise to board the bus and find out I didn’t have to buy a ticket today. I even had my change ready for a ticket. They should provide at least one such free day every week for us regular commuters,” said Mangala G. from Rajanukunte. Divya K. from Hebbal said, “I had to wait 15 minutes in the sun to get a bus and that cancels the incentive to travel for free. If they want to encourage more women to take buses, then BMTC should increase the frequency of buses at all times.” Demand to increase the frequency of buses also came from other parts of the city. Chethana R., who regularly travels from Vigyannagar to Shivajinagar said, “I am not a consistent user of BMTC, simply because finding one during late evening hours\\xa0- which is when I finish work - is rare. But otherwise, I have always found BMTC buses to be comfortable and fairly clean. I wish the corporation does something about introducing more buses to areas where the frequency is low, and more late night buses and metro feeder services.” When asked about the response received for free bus service, an official said, “On Wednesday, we operated all the scheduled services. We had asked the conductors to manually count the number of women passengers who availed the service. The number will be known on Thursday.” All-women crew operates train To mark celebrations of Women’s Day, the South Western Railway (SWR) operated KSR Bengaluru – Mysuru Rajyarani Express with an all-women crew. The train was piloted by Abhirami and assisted by Vijayalakshmi, Parthibha Singh, Vidya M. The train was flagged off by additional Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) Kusuma Hariprasad and other women staff from Bengaluru. In another initiative, the SWR, on Wednesday, for the first time deployed four women technicians\\xa0on the Bengaluru – Chennai Shatabdi Express to oversee technical works, including power supply from loco to power car, air condition accompanying duties and others. Mechanical staff deployed for the duty are Kavitha, Vandana, Raichel Ullaji and Kalpana. “The employees were given rigorous training for a period of three weeks. All the four employees nominated for accompanying duties were involved in maintenance activities for a very long period.” The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation felicitated Shobha Gasti, recipient of Nari Shakti award from Government of India. Ms. Gasti worked for empowerment of women and eradication of evil Devadasi system. Managing Director of KSRTC Anbu Kumar felicitated 42 employees of the KSRTC for their service.

Doctors also said that as animals lick their own skin when they feel irritation on the skin, the chemicals in the colours can enter their systems. “The chemicals contained in the cheap Holi powders are toxic for the fur of the animals. It can lead to mange,” said animal Activist Anishka Sarah George of Sarvoham Animal Foundation. Mange is a parasitic skin disease that causes itchiness, rash and hair loss. “It should be noted that the use of holi colours on animals can also cause conjunctivitis, rhinitis and other such diseases.” Not only colours, but the loud music and drums played during the celebration can cause trauma to canines. The animals might panic and release stress hormones. “Stray animals will be shaking and shivering after celebrations like these,” Ms. George said. During Holi, people also use water balloons to play. But it should not be used against animals, animal activists and veterinarians cautioned. “Cynophiles (people who are fond of dogs) can apply oil on stray animals, so that\\xa0in case people apply colours on them, it can be washed-off easily,” they said. As Holi is a festival which involves the use of colours and water and typically celebrated in an outdoor area, dermatologists have given out various tips to ensure skin safety during the festive times. They advice applying light oils and sunscreen to protect from heat and chemicals. “Stay hydrated. As you are mostly outdoors and under the sun, keeping yourself hydrated is much needed. Avoid wearing too much makeup as the chemicals that are present in your cosmetics can react with the colours further causing a skin reaction,” said Shireen Furtado, Consultant – Medical and Cosmetic Dermatology, Aster CMI Hospital. Suggestions for making colours from natural ingredients — like pink colour from beetroot and green colour from palak leaves - have also been circulated, urging people to choose safer colours.

Inauguration of four new traffic stations at Mahadevapura, Talaghattapura, Bellandur and Hennur has been done through restructuring and reorganising the adjacent police stations which had bigger jurisdiction, compared to the other police stations in the city.

He also said that the as per the police and people ratio, six more traffic police stations and nine law and order stations are in the pipeline. According to a senior police officer, the new police stations will play an important role in managing the traffic in the IT hubs, which has seen a drastic increase in the traffic and vehicle populations post the pandemic. “Work from home is over and regular office work has started. The new police stations and its staff have better traffic management and strategies for the local traffic management to cater to the needs at the local level in a more focused way,” said an officer.

The State is working on setting up a Health Emergency Operation Centre (HEOC) at Arogya Soudha. Karnataka’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) had, in December last year, recommended that the State should establish a Centre for Pandemic Preparedness (CPP) to help predict and prevent future outbreaks through stringent surveillance. To be funded by the Union Health Ministry, the HEOC will be a command and control facility where designated emergency management functions will be performed. “We have submitted a proposal to the Union Ministry in this regard and have also appointed a nodal officer for the Centre,” State Health Commissioner Randeep D. told The Hindu. In the last three years, as many as 40,269 people have lost their lives while over 40.74 lakh people have been infected by the different variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Over 46% of the total caseload and over 42% of the total fatalities are from Bengaluru Urban. The country’s first death was reported from Kalaburagi on March 12. While hospitals saw an acute shortage of testing and diagnosis infrastructure through the first wave (March-October 2020), the second wave (December 2020-November 2021), largely driven by Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, caught the health authorities unawares. The State’s health infrastructure was overwhelmed as the rise in caseload resulted in huge demand for hospital beds. Several patients died at home due to the non-availability of ICU beds and timely care. With many healthcare staff getting infected, lack of manpower also became a major issue. However, the Omicron-driven third wave (January-March 2022 onwards) was milder. Although the surge in cases was huge, the severity was low and the demand for hospital beds and oxygen was negligible. The situation was under control as a major chunk of the population had been vaccinated with at least one dose by then. Subsequently, in July-August 2022, there was a small spike but the situation was not serious as case numbers only fluctuated and have been at a low ebb since then. However, from March 1, 2023, onwards hospitalisations are gradually increasing in Bengaluru. From 12 hospitalisations on March 1, the number has gone up to 31 on Tuesday. Karnataka started its combat against the pandemic by converting the government-run Victoria Hospital into a dedicated COVID facility. Subsequently, almost all secondary and tertiary care public health facilities were turned into COVID hospitals. However, when government hospitals were unable to cater to the increasing caseload, the Health Department roped in private hospitals, most of whom were reluctant to turn into dedicated facilities initially. A centralised bed-allotment system was worked out only after patients lost their lives waiting for beds. After the third wave subsided, all health facilities resumed full-fledged non-COVID services.

The space agency executed the final two de-boost burns at 11.02 Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) and 12. 51 UTC respectively. The final perigee was estimated to be less than 80 km, indicating that the satellite would enter the denser layers of the Earth’s atmosphere and subsequently undergo structural disintegration. The re-entry aero-thermal flux analysis confirmed that there would be no surviving large debris fragments, ISRO said. The space agency added that from the latest telemetry, it is confirmed that the satellite has re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere and would have disintegrated over the Pacific Ocean, the final impact region estimated is in deep Pacific Ocean within the expected latitude and longitude boundaries. The entire sequence of events was carried out from the Mission Operations Complex in ISRO Telemetry Tracking and Command Network in Bengaluru. The Indo-French MT-1 satellite was launched in 2011 for carrying out tropical weather and climate studies. Since August 2022, the satellite’s perigee was progressively lowered through a series of 20 manoeuvres spending about 120 kg fuel. Multiple Manoeuvres including the final de-boost strategy was designed after taking into consideration several constraints, including visibility of the re-entry trace over ground stations, ground impact within the targeted zone, and allowable operating conditions of subsystems, especially the maximum deliverable thrust and the maximum firing duration constraint on thrusters. All manoeuvre plans were screened to ensure that there would be no post manoeuvre close approaches with other space objects, especially with the crewed space stations like International Space Stations and the Chinese Space Station, ISRO said.

She further said, “Due to various factors such as COVID-19, short supply in semiconductor chips, issues with hardware supplies and others, execution was delayed. The app will be launched once we achieve more accuracy on tracking buses. By March, we have planned to launch the app for public usage.” The app, which is under testing, has features such as identifying the nearest bus stop, journey planner, tracking a route, fare calculator, purchase of tickets and passes. “The application will be used by lakhs of people in the city. Considering the magnitude of the usage of the app in the coming days, we have to achieve accuracy of data to make the application more useful for the general public. To achieve\\xa0the desired accuracy on the data which is AI-backed, we need some time. We are on the job and will shortly introduce the mobile app. Other than primary functions such as real time information on bus arrivals, trip planning and others, the app provides various safety features that include SoS, informing a near one about the bus in which they are travelling and route,” A.V.Surya Sen, Director (IT), BMTC.

The Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai, plans to expand its observational network in a phased manner to ensure better accuracy of its forecasts. It is in the process of identifying new sites to install automatic rain gauges and weather stations across the State. In Chennai, there are 12 ARGs and AWS. Adding more stations, particularly in urban areas, would contribute to accurate prediction of weather events unique to urban areas. S. Balachandran, Additional Director General of Meteorology, RMC, Chennai, said: “We are looking to use artificial intelligence to upgrade weather forecast techniques and analyse radar data. Artificial intelligence and machine learning would be used in issuing nowcast for improving forecasts for shorter duration.” He was speaking on the sidelines of the seminar on Monsoon 2022, organised jointly by Indian Meteorological Society-Chennai chapter and the RMC in the city on Wednesday. Various aspects of the monsoon in 2022, which brought good rainfall over the State, were discussed during the seminar. In his presentation on Southwest monsoon 2022, P. Senthamarai Kannan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, said the Southwest monsoon played a crucial role in ensuring water availability. Failure in the Southwest monsoon would shift the burden on the Northeast monsoon to fulfil water requirement. He highlighted the heavy rainfall patterns, particularly in the Nilgiris and the Western Ghats in July last year. B. Geetha, scientist, RMC, who spoke about the Northeast monsoon, said Tamil Nadu recorded normal rainfall during the monsoon last year. Last year, the Southwest monsoon had extended up to October 23. There were four days of extremely heavy rainfall, spread over the season. Noting that it has been 50 years since radar came to Chennai, B. Arul Malar Kannan, scientist and in-charge of doppler weather radar facility, said the S-band analogue radar was installed in 1972 and functioned till the doppler weather radar replaced it. He explained on how indigenously renovated radar helped in tracking cyclone Mandous last year. R. Nallaswamy, secretary, IMS, also spoke.

Nehru for the construction of new toilets and renovation of existing toilets and urinals in 372 places at an estimated cost ₹430 crores. The new toilets will come up in 372 places in Royapuram, Thiru Vi Ka Nagar and Teynampet (Marina) in the span of one year. Private companies have been tasked with maintaining these toilets for eight years. Currently, the corporation has 954 public toilets. The corporation is exploring the public-private partnership (PPP) mode again to improve the city’s infrastructure, including that of toilets and bus shelters. The PPP mode ensures a degree of standardisation of facilities and is part of a pilot project, officials said. The corporation’s main objective is to provide good sanitation facilities to the people and reduce incidences of open defecation. Three contractors have been selected — MSB ARCH Project Consultants Private Limited, METEC Design and Construction Engineers and Ferrgra Private Enterprises Limited. “The private contractors will have an intrinsic responsibility in maintaining the toilets because they can display advertisements and generate their own revenue. That is why we have chosen this model,” said a corporation official. Wilson, a resident of Perungudi, said women and school students would benefit the most from clean public toilets and that there should be toilets near all bus stands. The corporation is conducting feasibility studies to expand this initiative to other populous zones such as Ambattur, Anna Nagar and Kodambakkam. In Royapuram alone, 51 new toilets will be constructed, 71 highly and 105 less dilapidated toilets renovated; totally they have a seating capacity of 2159 people. In Thiru Vi Ka Nagar, works will be done in 134 places with a seating capacity of 988. At Marina, three new toilets will be constructed and eight existing ones will be renovated.
